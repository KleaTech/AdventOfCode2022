# Advent of Code 2022

### My goal this year is to solve the puzzles each in a single statement.

No for loops, variables or if-else statements this year. I don't expect that I'll realistically be able to solve every puzzle this way, but I'll do my best. Day 2 solutions will give you the basic idea how difficult this might be.
